# URL Redirect Thingy

So, you’ve found yourself in one of life’s odd little situations: a browser with no URL bar. Maybe you’re playing a game, or using some quirky app, and *surprise!*—you need to visit a website but there’s no place to type in that all-important URL. Enter this little page. Problem solved. And, just to be nice, I’ve made it publicly available at **[https://redirect.xecutiv.net/](https://redirect.xecutiv.net/)** and **[https://gotourl.org/](https://gotourl.org/)**. Now you’ve got options. Lucky you!

## Features (If You Can Call Them That)

- **Centered Design:** Because a box and button floating in the corner would be just sad.
- **Instant Redirect:** Type a URL, click "Go." You’re off to wherever you need to be.
- **Bootstrap-ish:** We used Bootstrap 5.3.3 because, let's be honest, custom CSS is overrated when Bootstrap can do the job.

## Who Would Use This?

For the niche folks out there stuck in a game or app where the browser lacks a URL bar—yes, that actually happens. Maybe you’re in a game that lets you browse on a fake PC, or you’re just in some weird app environment. If that’s you, go ahead and visit **[https://redirect.xecutiv.net/](https://redirect.xecutiv.net/)** or **[https://gotourl.org/](https://gotourl.org/)** and get where you need to go.

## How to Use It (Because It’s Super Complicated)

1. Type "gotourl org" into google or any other search engine to go to **[GoToUrl](https://gotourl.org/)**, or "github gotourl" to get to this GitHub repository: **[GitHub](https://github.com/louisbockel/gotourl)**
2. Type your URL in the box (you know how this works).
3. Click "Go." That’s it. Seriously.

## Why Does This Exist?

Honestly, I don’t know either. But I was playing "Supermarket Simulator" and downloaded the DLC "The Cool Pack," which lets you mess around with some in-game computers. I wanted to watch something with my friends on different screens, but guess what? The browsers had no URL bars. So, like any reasonable person, I built this.
